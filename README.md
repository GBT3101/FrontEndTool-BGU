# FrontEndTool-BGU
This web application is a tool for BGU students to test their NodeJS server.

# Overview

Hello, this web application will be used as a tool to test your NodeJS and help you implement it step by step, follow the instructions and have fun.

# Installation

*Make sure you have `git`, `npm` and `Nodejs 7.2.0` installed on your pc.*

1. First, open your command line and clone / download this project to your pc:

# BlackJack - How To Play

In BlackJack you battle the dealer about who will be closer to 21.

Keep pressing "Hit Me" and get cards until you feel it's enough and then press "Submit Hand", closer to 21 than the dealer? good job, passed 21? you lost :) That simple.
